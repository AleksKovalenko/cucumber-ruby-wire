Feature: Wire protocol table diffing

  In order to use the amazing functionality in the Cucumber table object
  As a wire server
  I want to be able to ask for a table diff during a step definition invocation

  Background:
    Given a file named "features/wired.feature" with:
      """
      Feature: Hello
        Scenario: Wired
          Given we're all wired
